PyGG2-3.0 - What is it?
====================

PyGG2-3.0 is a Python3 port of  [PyGG2](https://github.com/PyGG2/PyGG2), which is a python2 port of [Gang Garrison 2](http://ganggarrison.com/).


Why is this not working?
------------
This is alot of work, specifically porting pySFML to pygame.

Why are you doing this? The game has been dead for 7 years!
------------
Because it would be a cool project.
Also in the hopes that this will help revive the game.

Dependencies
------------

PyGG2-3.0 requires the following dependencies, in addition to Python 3.x:

* [pygame ](https://pypi.org/project/pygame)
* [pySFML ](https://pypi.org/project/sfml/) (CURRENTLY NOT WORKING/BEING USED!)
