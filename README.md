PyGG2-3.0 - What is it?
====================

PyGG2-3.0 is a Python3 port of  [PyGG2](https://github.com/PyGG2/PyGG2), which is a python2 port of [Gang Garrison 2](http://ganggarrison.com/).


Why is this not working?
------------
This is alot of work, so I probably didnt get there yet.
As of now, I'm looking for alternatives to pySFML, because it has terrible support for windows nowadays.

Why are you doing this? The game has been dead for 7 years!
------------
Because it would be a cool project.
Also in the hopes that this will help revive the game.

Dependencies
------------

PyGG2-3.0 requires the following dependencies, in addition to Python 3.x:

* [pySFML ](https://pypi.org/project/sfml/) 
* [Python Imaging Library](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
* PyGG2-3.0 bitmask extension (compile with `python make.py build`, with `gcc` in path)
